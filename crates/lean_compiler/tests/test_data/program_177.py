# Comprehensive test for dynamic_unroll
# Tests: edge cases, mutable accumulators, array writes, nested dynamic_unroll,
#        multiple dynamic_unrolls in one function, conditional body logic,
#        interaction with regular unroll, and varying n_bits.
#
# Note: n_bits should be kept small (<=8) since the generated code size is O(2^n_bits).
